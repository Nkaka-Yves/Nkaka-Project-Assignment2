        <p>This is a page that takes a user's birthday 
            and calculates the day of the week they were 
            born and then depending on their gender outputs 
            their Akan Name. 
            Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds 
            to the day in the week they were born.Here are Ghanian day names.</p>
